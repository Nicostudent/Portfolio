            Hi, I'm Nico, I'm 35 years old. I recently finished a Javascript programming bootcamp, if you want you can see my certificate 
            <a href='https://certificates.soyhenry.com/cert?id=657318fd-cd1e-48d2-bac5-5ae58c2177df' target="_blank"> here </a>.
             I started a year ago, and being my first contact with the IT world, I found it strange and complicated.
              Since then it has been quite a while and I learned a lot, I would love to have my first work experience in this field,
               with a good group to be able to learn, grow and develop as a programmer.
                I found that I love reading code and seeing what other people can develop, the ingenuity and logic they use.
                I am currently reinforcing my knowledge of javascript and learn a little react native. I would be delighted to be hired and give my best.
            </p>

            In my free time I like to climb, read and be in contact with nature.
