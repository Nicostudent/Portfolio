            Hello, I'm Nico, I'm 34 years old. I am currently studying Javascript programming. I started a year ago in a bootcamp, being my first contact with the IT world, I found it strange and complicated. Since then it has been quite a while and I learned a lot, I would love to have my first work experience in this field, with a good group to be able to learn, grow and develop as a programmer.
            I found that I love reading code and seeing what other people can develop, the ingenuity and logic they use.
            I would be delighted to be hired and give my best.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            In my free time I like to climb, read and be in contact with nature. 
            </p>
        </div>
